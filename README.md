Some of my favorite dev tools, tutorials, and resouces on the web

## CSS

### Guides

- **[A Complete Guide To Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)**
    - One of the most comprehensive and straightfoward guides to one of the most useful css properties. Need something spaced out or centered? This is it. 
- [A Complete Guide To CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
    - More complex and granular than flexbox, allows for better control of space in a layout.
- Use flexbox and grid together for robust layouts that flow and space themselves out on any device.
